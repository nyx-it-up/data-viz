# data-viz
The intent with this code is to push my data-viz skills when it comes to python visualizations and to practice coding more frequently. 
My first visualizations will be following tutorials from Yan Holtz, available here: https://python-graph-gallery.com/
Data or subjects will be things I find interesting in my everyday life, using datasources where available.
